# LinkedIn Post: When To Go

---

**Stop guessing when to leave for the airport.** ‚úàÔ∏è

I built a probabilistic calculator that replaces "arrive 2 hours early" with actual math. Inspired by Gad Allon's research on airport timing optimization, it uses Monte Carlo simulation to find your optimal departure time based on:

‚Ä¢ Real traffic conditions
‚Ä¢ TSA wait time distributions (with ex-Gaussian tails for nightmare scenarios)
‚Ä¢ Rush hour correlation effects
‚Ä¢ Your personal risk tolerance

Run 10,000 simulations in your browser. Get a personalized recommendation. Or use the iOS Shortcut to pull your next flight from Calendar and get real-time traffic from Apple Maps.

**Looking for feedback** on airport data quality, UX for probabilistic recommendations, and what other factors to model.
